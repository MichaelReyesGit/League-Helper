          Hello! My name is Michael Reyes. I am currently an aspiring software
          engineer in-training at Pursuit. This is my first ever solo app
          development. It was honestly a bit rough deciding what to do for this,
          but it ultimately came down to two factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first factor is that I have both a strong love of video games and
          want to help make games more easily accessible to a wider audience.
          League of Legends is a game I’ve sunk way too much time into over the
          years and have had multiple friends come forward and ask me the same
          questions: there’s so many characters in this game, where do I start?
          This app was a response to that common question. Though it may seem a
          little barebones it is a stepping stone for people to see what kind of
          characters might interest them, be it from a story standpoint or ease
          of use. The helper will show the look of a champ and give some light
          tips if they are available and gesture for the user to continue into
          more official (and flashy looking) channels to explore more. Hopefully
          for my friends that are interested but not quite sure if they should
          try the game can use this as an icebreaker to see if they are really
          interested.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second factor for why I created this app is because riot has
          recently announced a revamp of the difficulty systems within League to
          better help new and returning players, citing current systems as being
          a little outdated (you can read about some of those changes
          <a
            href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/champion-pricing-update/"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >). I decided to use this app to not only see how the current system
          rates champions and shares tips, but to eventually compare it to newer
          changes that may happen down the line. This serves as a time capsule
          for some data of the game in that sense, as the app will only draw
          data from the current patch. So whether you’re one of my friends I’m
          passing it around to or someone stumbling upon this years from now, I
          hope you enjoy this small snapshot of one of my (reluctantly) most
          played games.
