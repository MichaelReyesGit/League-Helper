### Searching by name

You can search for a specific champion by entering their name in the first search bar. If no matching champion is found, you will receive an error message. Once you hit "search champ," you will receive a brief overview of the champion, along with some useful tips if available. You will also find a link to the champion's official League of Legends page for more in-depth information.

### Searching by difficulty

You can search for champions by difficulty level using the "search by difficulty" field. Enter a value between 1 and 10, and the application will search for all champions in the game with a matching difficulty level. Once you hit "submit," you will see a grid of images of champions within that difficulty level. You can hover over them for a look at their name and title. Clicking the image will provide more information, similar to searching by name.
